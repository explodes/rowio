RowIO
=====

Schemaless protobuf database system.


*GOALS*

 - Schema-less database
 - Set and forget database storage
 - _Queryable_
 
 
 This experiment doesn't fullfil the queryable aspect, so I will no longer pursue development for
 RowIO.
 
 Another concept database is underway to replace it.
 
 
 RowIO as a service does work, however. It just can be done better.
